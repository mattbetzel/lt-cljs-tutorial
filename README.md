# Light Table Clojure Tutorial

An introduction to the
[Clojure](http://clojure.org/) programming
language aimed at [Light Table](http://www.lighttable.com) users. If you have
an old version of Light Table, you may need to upgrade to 0.6.X or newer.

Install [Leiningen](http://leiningen.org). You can then open
`lt-clj-tutorial.clj` in Light Table and evaluate it interactively.

This tutorial was originally written for ClojureScript and has been adopted to
Clojure.
